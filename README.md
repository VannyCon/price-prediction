# PRICE PREDICTION USING MONTE CARLO SIMULATION
### Overview
Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful computational technique used for price prediction by modeling the inherent uncertainty and variability in financial markets. In this method, various input variables, such as market volatility, interest rates, and asset prices, are randomly sampled from their respective probability distributions. The simulation then generates numerous possible future scenarios, and the model calculates the corresponding outcomes. By repeating this process thousands or millions of times, a probability distribution of possible future prices is obtained. This distribution provides insights into the range of potential outcomes and their associated probabilities, allowing investors and analysts to make more informed decisions and assess the risk associated with different market conditions. Monte Carlo simulation is particularly valuable for pricing complex financial instruments and understanding the potential impact of various factors on price movements.

### Features
Easy Input Of Product Name, Initial Price & Volatility. After Input those you will see the Output in the table where you can see the Future High Stock Price (Color GREEN) & Future Low Stock Price (Color RED).
